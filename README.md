## Technologies

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.

## Installation

To run the quiz application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-quiz-app.git
   cd javascript-quiz-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   The project uses Node.js modules. Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Serve the Application**:
   Use a local server to serve the files (e.g., `live-server` or any static file server):
   ```bash
   npm install -g live-server
   live-server
   ```
   Alternatively, you can open `index.html` directly in a browser, but some features (like fetching the JSON file) may require a server due to CORS restrictions.

## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Click the **Generate Question** button to display a random question.
3. Select an answer by clicking one of the provided options (A or B).
4. The selected answer will be highlighted:
   - **Green** for correct answers.
   - **Red** for incorrect answers.
5. Click **Generate Question** again to load a new question.

The quiz tracks the current question number and the total number of questions, displayed above the question.
